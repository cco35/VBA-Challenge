# VBA-Challenge
This repository contains my submission for assignment 2 in the Columbia Data Analytics Bootcamp. We were tasked with developing a VB Script capable of processing large amounts of stock data in an Excel file. Each Excel file could contain several sheets and the Script can run across all sheets once initialized. A single sheet contains thousands of rows comprising daily pricing information for multiple stocks from the beginning to the end of a specific year. The script is capable of calculating the difference in the closing price for each stock at the start and end of the year, the percentage change, and the total volume traded for the calendar year. For each year the script also identifies which stock had the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest volume of stock traded for that year.
The script as well as screenshots of the expected results are included in the repo.
