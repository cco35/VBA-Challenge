# VBA Stock Market Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains VBA scripts for analyzing stock market data using Excel. The scripts are designed to loop through stock data for one year, calculate various metrics, and identify stocks with the greatest percentage increase, decrease, and total volume. The project includes different levels of solutions: basic, moderate, and hard, to cater to varying complexity requirements.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- `Test Files/`: Folder containing additional files for testing and development.
  - `alphabetical_testing.xlsx`: Sample dataset used for testing.
- `Excel Files/`: Folder containing Excel files for data analysis.
  - `multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx`: Dataset with multiple sheets for 2018, 2019, and 2020.
- `Images/`: Folder containing summary images of analysis results for each year.
  - `2018 Results.png`: Summary of results for the year 2018.
  - `2019 Resultspng`: Summary of results for the year 2019.
  - `2020 Results.png`: Summary of results for the year 2020.
- `Stock VB Script.vbs`: VBA script file containing the main analysis code.
- `README.md`: Project README file with instructions and details.

## Instructions
1. Download the repository files.
2. Open `Stock VB Script.vbs` in Excel.
3. Ensure `multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx` in the `Excel Files/` folder is accessible.
4. Run the VBA script to perform the following tasks:
   - Calculate yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume for each stock.
   - Identify stocks with the greatest percentage increase, decrease, and total volume.
   - Apply conditional formatting to highlight positive and negative changes.

## Usage
Follow these steps to use the VBA script:
1. Open `Stock VB Script.vbs` in Excel.
2. Click on the "Run" or "Start" button within the VBA editor to execute the script.
3. View the results in the Excel worksheet with the analysis output.

## Notes
- Use the provided `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` dataset in the `Test Files/` folder for testing and development.
- Ensure the script runs efficiently within 3 to 5 minutes on the provided dataset.
- Customize the script as needed for additional datasets or specific requirements
